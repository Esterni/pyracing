# Contributing (Under Construction)

Please feel free to open issues, offer suggestions, or fork and submit a pull request to help polish things up here. We only ask that you be willing to openly discuss things in a respectful manner. If you'd like to chat in Discord, I can be reached in the [iRacing Open Wheel Discord](https://discord.gg/UwnhM7w) (nearing 1000 members!). My username is Jacob Anderson7#4903. I'd be happy to hear from those interested in this project and if enough people reach out I'll make a section just for this project.

# About

This document is to provide a baseline reference for this projects code style as well as give meaning to the names of the datapoints

# Code Style

The [PEP8 Styleguide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) should be your goto reference when naming conventions are in question. 

- Variable names use snake_case.
- Class names use CamelCase. (CapitalizedWords)
- Constants use ALL_CAPS.

# Datapoint Definitions
Here we will layout terms that are unique to iRacing and how we, as users, often abbreviate them. The idea is to reduce how verbose some of the datapoint names can be and bring them more in line with the names that we would see as a user of the service. 

The format will be `Our Name : iRacing's Name - Some insight to what the datapoint means.`
